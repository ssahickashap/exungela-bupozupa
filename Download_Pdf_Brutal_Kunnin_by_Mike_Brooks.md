Ork action at it&amp;#039;s finest, join us for the next epic Waaagh!

 Ufthak Blackhawk and the green tide descend upon Hephaesto â€“ an Adeptus Mechanicus forge world bristling with loot â€“ only to find it already under siege by the notorious Freebooter Kaptin Badrukk. When his warboss, Da Biggest Big Mek, orders temporary co-operation, Ufthak seeks to make a name for himself by crushing some of the Imperiumâ€™s most advanced defenders and claiming the greatest prize. But with a sinister new war machine on the horizon, Badrukkâ€™s plotting, and a thoroughly annoying grot in his way, Ufthak is going to need the brutal kunninâ€™ of Mork himself just to survive.
