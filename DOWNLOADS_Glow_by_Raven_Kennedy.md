Overview
The BookTok hit: The Plated Prisoner Series continues in book 4. This dark adult fantasy romance is inspired by the myth of King Midas and the gold-touched woman who realizes her true worth. &quot;I was nothing but a road to Midas. A means to get to where he wanted to go, and I paved that path in gold.&quot; My life as been made up of gilded lies. But death has been shaped from rot. Like a phoenix caught fire, I will need to rise from the ashes and learn to wield my own power. Because my wings may have been clipped, but I am not in a cage, and I&#039;m finally free to fly from the frozen kingdoms I&#039;ve been kept in. Yet the world doesn&#039;t want to let me. That&#039;s the thing when you turn against a king-everyone else turns against you. Good thing I have a different king in my corner. But even with the dark threat of Slade Ravinger, the other monarchs are coming for me. So I will fight for him and he will kill for me, and if we need to become the villains, then so be it. Because so long as I live in this world, I won&#039;t be used again. Please note: This is an adult fantasy series with dark elements that may be triggering, including past emotional and physical trauma, violence, adult language, and explicit romance. Read at your own discretion.
