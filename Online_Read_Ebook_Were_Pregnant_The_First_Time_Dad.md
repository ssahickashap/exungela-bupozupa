Overview
We&#039;re Pregnant! The First Time Dad&#039;s Pregnancy Handbook by Adrian Kulp “While nothing can truly prepare a man for fatherhood, this book comes pretty darn close. Part handbook, part handholding, Adrian’s words will comfort and prepare even the most terrified dads-to-be. Your partners will thank you, I promise!” —Jill Smokler, founder of Scary Mommy Being a great first-time dad doesn’t mean being perfect. It means having the tools you need to be a supportive partner during and after pregnancy—which is exactly what We’re Pregnant! The First-Time Dad’s Pregnancy Handbook is all about. From heartburn and headaches to birth and breastfeeding, We’re Pregnant! features practical, action-oriented pregnancy advice from the author of the Dad or Alive blog, Adrian Kulp, a (once clueless) dad who’s been there and done that—three times, in fact! We’re Pregnant! addresses and alleviates the stress first-time dads face through candid pregnancy guidance, including: Week-specific pregnancy milestones so you’re not left wondering what’s happening, what’s going to happen, or what you should be doing during the pregnancy Practical suggestions for supporting your partner’s changing needs during pregnancy and thereafter Action-oriented goals that will support baby’s development, mom’s pregnancy experience, and the wellbeing of your relationship Up-to-date information on “The Fourth Trimester” so you’re as prepared for the first months of baby’s life as you were during pregnancy We’re Pregnant! delivers real-world pregnancy advice with a humorous tone that will get first-time dads ready, willing, and able to carry their portion of the pregnancy weight….pickles and ice cream not included.
