Overview
Science gets the stitched treatment in this stunning science book from textile artist Lauren Wright Vartanian. During the pandemic, Lauren started stitching an ABC book of science, but it soon became clear that some of the topics she was exploring were too advanced for your average toddler. Out of this was born Stitching Science, a book for any person who loves science, art and how the two intersect. Scientific topics ranging from Atom to Zenith come to life at the end of Lauren&#039;s skilled needle, and lively and informative text by Keltie Thomas explains key concepts and delivers interesting facts for each subject. Readers will explore topics in physics, biology, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics and more, such as: B is for Black hole D is for DNA F is for Fractal and Fibonacci Numbers L is for Lichen O is for Organ Q is for Quantum T is for Triceratops and Tyrannosaurs W is for Weather. Lauren&#039;s meticulous textile artworks are sure to enchant readers, and the art has been expertly scanned to best show the painstaking detail and skill she applied to each panel. Stitching Science is a charming and informative introduction to a wide variety of scientific concepts as well as a beautiful art book from a talented textile artist.
