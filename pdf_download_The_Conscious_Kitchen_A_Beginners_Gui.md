Overview
Immy Lucas of popular YouTube channel Sustainably Vegan empowers you to embrace seasonal, plant-based eating and other low-impact practices to create your own conscious kitchen.
 Â 
 We all want to make a difference in the fight against climate change. We all want to live on a healthier planet, have healthier homes, invest in a healthier future. But going fully zero-waste, living off-grid, or completely abandoning fossil fuels isnâ€™t easy, affordable, or even possible for many people. For the average consumer who just wants to do a little better, where to begin?
 
 For Immy Lucas, the answer is clear. Since our food system is one of the most high-impact, wasteful areas of modern life, theÂ path to a more sustainable future starts in the kitchen. InÂ The Conscious Kitchen,Â Immy provides you with the starting tools you need to create a more sustainable kitchen in your own home by rethinking the way you source, prepare, cook, store, and dispose of food.Â 
 
 Rooted in a strong foundation ofÂ seasonal, plant-based eating, the book is all about how small steps can have a big impact. How switching to a more seasonal way of eating, being a more considerate shopper, investing in traditional skills like pickling and fermenting, and considering alternative uses for food scraps and leftovers can helpÂ improve the health of your home and, ultimately, the health of the planet.
 
 In The Conscious Kitchen, youâ€™ll discover:
 Â  A guide to year-round seasonal eating with more than 30 plant-based recipes Food preservation recipes and techniques based on traditional skills like canning, preserving, and fermenting food Strategies and recipes for cooking with food scraps and leftovers Ethical shopping and food sourcing guidelines Easy food storage and organization hacks to help your stores last longer An overview of composting techniques and how to use compost to start your first kitchen garden And more! Eminently practical, approachable, and ideal for beginners, The Conscious Kitchen is the perfect book for climate advocates, vegan cooks, homesteaders, zero-waste warriors, and anyone interested in taking their first steps into the world of more sustainable living.
